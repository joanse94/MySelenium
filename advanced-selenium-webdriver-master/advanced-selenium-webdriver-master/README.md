Code examples for Advanced Selenium Webdriver course on Udemy.

This course is for people who already know some basics of test automation with selenium, and want to improve their knowledge and be able to build cool test framework.

It is basically a continuation of my "Selenium WebDriver for beginners" course where students learned some web driver basics.

During this course, we will be automating testing of one web app, like you would do at your work. So at the end, students will have real world example of one full stack test automation framework, that will include data driven test framework and page object model.
